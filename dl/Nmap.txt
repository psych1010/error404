# Practical 7

## ACK -sA (TCP ACK scan)

It never determines open (or even open|filtered) ports. It is used to map out firewall rulesets, determining whether they are stateful or not & which ports are filtered.

```bash
nmap -sA -T4 scanme.nmap.org
```

### SYN (Stealth) Scan (-sS)

SYN scan is the default & most popular scan option for good reasons. It can be performed quickly, scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast network & not hampered by intrusive firewall.

```bash
nmap -p22,113,139 scanme.nmap.org
```

### FIN Scan (-sF)

Sets just the TCP FIN bit.

```bash
nmap -sF -T4 www.google.com
```

### NULL Scan (-sN)

Does not set any bits (TCP flag header is 0).

```bash
nmap -sN -p 22 scanme.nmap.org
```

### XMAS Scan (-sX)

Sets the FIN, PSH & URG flags, lighting the packet up like a christmas tree.

```bash
nmap -sX -T4 scanme.nmap.org
```
